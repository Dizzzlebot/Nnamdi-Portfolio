        Hello my name is Nnamdi Iroham, I am a recent graduate from SMU Coding Bootcamp Full Stack Development. 
        I love challenges that comes about with the knowledge and learning computer programming. Striving to achieve
        success in the midst of difficulties seems to strengthen one's focus and determination. Although new to programming,
        I look forward in attaining more knowledge and build on my skill set in order to achieve massive success.
    </P>
